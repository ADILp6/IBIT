Dear R,
Hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to you on behalf of IBIT. Recently, We are planning to visit the Khadimnogor Reserve forest as annual tour.  
I would like to greateful to you if you give us permission to visit there also provide some further information regarding the tour.

I have some query regarding this study tour. Firstly, We are around 100 students. I would like to know the facilities it provides. And is it family friendly ? Secondly, What other facilities it provide.

I am waiting to get your response. 

Your sincerely
Something
