Write a formal letter to the company's manager for delay in delivery




Dear Manager,

On 10/09/11 I ordered the following from you:

A pair of Swift trainers.

I paid a deposit of Â£20 by credit card.

The reference number for my order was 13243546.

I was expecting to take delivery of the item on 12/02/2019, but at present I have still not received the goods. Failure to deliver within a reasonable time and after the agreed deadline is a breach under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Time is now essential. Please deliver the item as soon as possible. If you do not, I will expect a full refund.

Yours sincerely



Peter
