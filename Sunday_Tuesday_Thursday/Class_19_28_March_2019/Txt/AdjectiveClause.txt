An adjective clause, also known as an adjectival clause, is a type of dependent clause that works to describe a noun in a sentence. It functions as an adjective even though it is made up of a group of words instead of just one word. In the case of an adjective clause, all the words work together to modify the noun or pronoun.




All adjective clauses are dependent clauses. A dependent clause is a group of words that consists of a subject and a verb, yet it is not a complete sentence that can stand alone. Adjective clauses begin with a relative pronoun, which connects them to the word they describe, such as:

that
where
when
who
whom
whose
which
why
