Write a letter to the Mayor of your city seeking a solution to the problem of water logging in your area.
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dear Mayor,
I am Hasnat, a resident of Sylhet City Corporation. The residents of the area are facing a lot of problems due to water logging. 
Every year in the monsoon season, the area gets filled with water as the drainage system gets choked. We have requested the area committee many times, but the situation is still the same. The residents’ lives have become miserable as many water - borne diseases have spread. All the houses are submerged, and we are facing a tough time. 

Please consider the issue as serious and find a solution at the earliest.





Hi! You are invited to my birthday party on 25th August. 
The party will be at Arkedia from 5:00 to 7:00 PM. As the party is based on ‘Spiderman’ theme, please wear a dress in red / black colour combination. It will be fun as I have arranged a Mask game, a ‘Spidey’ web game and a never – seen – before neon light and music show. I am very excited as I will wear the special Spidey costume designed by my sister. Please come as it will be good to have your company. Also, bring your brother Saurav. 
Waiting for your confirmation.
