Subject Line: Application For Leave of Absense. 


Sir,
This is to inform you that I availed one day leave on 5th January 2016 as I needed to go to Sylhet due to some urgent family purpose. I informed this to CEO sir & got his verbal consent as well. Unfortunately, I couldn't apply it in paper earlier as I needed to go on a short notice. 

Sir, it will be nice if you please consider this leave & oblige me thereby. Thanks in advance for kind consideration.


Regards
Ahmad Sharif
