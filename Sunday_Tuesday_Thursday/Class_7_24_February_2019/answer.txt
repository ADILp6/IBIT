Task 2
1. In 1913, Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. 
2. He was the first non-European to receive it. 
3. His coming by the Nobel created much excitement not only in India but outside it as well. 
4. Rabindranath, not at all known outside India before the publication of his Gitanjali in its English version in November 1912 from London, made millions of people sit up and take notice of him through the prize. 
5. William Butler Yeats (1865-1939), a reputed Irish poet even before 1913 and eventually a Nobel laureate himself, in 1923, was a great admirer of Rabindranath during his Gitanjali days, though he did not rejoice at the declaration of the Nobel Committee on November 13, 1913. 
6. A study of Nobel nominations will perhaps give us an idea of the process involved. On 10 December every year the year's laureate has to receive the prize and deliver a lecture. 
7. Very recently the web site of the Nobel Committee released a wealth of information that gives us a fresh perspective on the Nobel process itself.
