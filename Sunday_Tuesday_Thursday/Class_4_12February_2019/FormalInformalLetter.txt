I beg to state that I was absent on 18 December 2018 because I had a pain in my head.
I beg to state that I was absent on 18 December 2018 because I was ill.
This is to inform you that I was absent on last 16 November, 2018 due to some urgent official formalities in BRTA  for my personal driving license.

Prior taking leave I had informed this to Mr. Rahim and got verbal consent.

Before that I called to my class teacher and he told me ok.



Sir, it will be nice if you please consider this absence & oblige me thereby. Thanks in advance for kind consideration.

Therefore I request you to grant my leave of absence and oblige thereby.
