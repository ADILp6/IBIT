MEMBER FORM
What kind of membership do you want to have? Trial of one month or a full one year subscription ? Explain your choice
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
I am interested to get one month trail for several reasons. Firstly, I want to get its premium feature as a trial basis to know what it is the difference between free and premium services. Secondly, As I am a student I could not able to afford to pay one year subscription fee at a time. That's why I think one month trail is best for me.

Dear members,
This is to inform you that from next month there won’t be any trial version of membership.

Dear Hasan,
Hope you are fine. I am writing this letter to let you share my view regarding the notice from Bikroy which is about monthly subscription that is 200 Tk per month. I don't think it is a wise decision that has been made as most of our people are not tech-savvy and we are not used to this form of technology. It takes time to us to adopt such platform. 
That's why I think the subscribtion fees should impose to us at this stage. They should rather promote by providing other feature to make such platform popular.


Thanks,
Naem.





Dear Manager,
I am writing this letter to let you share my view regarding subscribtion fee which has been imposed recently. In mu opinion, the management of Bikroy might take some time as we are not a developed country and people are not used to such technology based platform. In addition, in our country payment method is a major issue which has not fixed yet. I know there are some payment gateway are doing their best to solve the payment issue.  However, there are many limitation and restrictions to use running payment gateway. Lastly, I think as most of our common people are not to used these type of platform. That's why the Bikroy management might provide service free for next frew years to promote. I know that Bikroy is carrying lots of expenditure to run this platform. However, For greater interest the management might consider following issues.


Following are my ideas, I think Bikroy members have many nice idea that can be also consider as alternative solutions.

I am looking forward to hearing from you as your earliest convenience.

Best Regards,
Ahmad Sharif
