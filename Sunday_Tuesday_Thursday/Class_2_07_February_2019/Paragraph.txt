I am going to describe one of my friend whose name is Ruhul Rubel Khan. We introduced each other in our academic building during the class. In my short life, I have never ever met anyone like him. As a person, he is an introvert, altruist, ingenuous. He has a vehement voice and involved in recitation club to practice poem. 


In addition, He is a voracious reader who loves to read literature, poems, article, criticism, prose, fiction and non-fiction, novel, biography and profound knowledge in physics particularly in astronomy also other contemporary section of science. I introduced and learned many sophisticated topics from him and this is my please to meet him in this planet. However, He is very lazy and unenthusiastic in his academic study. Whatever he is, I don't care. I wish him all the best.
